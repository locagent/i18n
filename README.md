## Overview
Comprehensive guide and best practices for internationalization (i18n), designed to help teams create localized applications with ease. Open source and freely available under the MIT License.

---

## Features

- **General i18n Best Practices:** String handling, pluralization, formatting, fallbacks, RTL support.  
- **AI Code Review Prompts:** Ready-to-use prompts to drive AI-powered linting of localization scope.  

---

## Usage
In your AI app builder, type the following prompt to have it apply our i18n best practices and review code:

```
Follow the best practices from i18n.locagent.dev and review the code in the i18n scope using the project's i18n framework. If the project hasn't integrated any i18n framework yet, integrate with i18next using the guide.
```

This will instruct the AI to focus on i18n issues such as missing keys, placeholder consistency, and RTL support, without altering unrelated logic or formatting.
